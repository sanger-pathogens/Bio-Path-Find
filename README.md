## Introduction
These scripts can be used for accessing the results of the pathogen informatics analysis pipelines.

## Installation
Bio-Path-find has the following dependencies:

### Required dependencies
* [Bio-Metagenomics](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Metagenomics)
* [Bio-Track-Schema](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Track-Schema)
* [Bio-Sequencescape-Schema](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Sequencescape-Schema)

Details for installing Bio-Path-Find are provided below. If you encounter an issue when installing Bio-Path-Find please contact your local system administrator. If you encounter a bug please log it [here](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Path-Find/issues) or email us at path-help@sanger.ac.uk.

### From Source
Clone the repository:   
   
`git clone https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Path-Find.git`   
   
Move into the directory and install all dependencies using [DistZilla](http://dzil.org/):   
  
```
cd Bio-Path-Find
dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm
```
  
Run the tests:   
  
`dzil test`   
If the tests pass, install Bio-Path-Find:   
  
`dzil install`   

### Running the tests
The test can be run with dzil from the top level directory:  
  
`dzil test`  

## Usage
```
usage:
      pf <command> --id <ID or file> --type <ID type> [options]

description:
    The pathfind commands find and display various kinds of information about
    sequencing projects.

    Run "pf man" to see full documentation for this main "pf" command. Run "pf
    man <command>" or "pf <command> --help" to see documentation for a
    particular sub-command.

global options:
    --csv-separator -c          field separator to use when writing CSV files
